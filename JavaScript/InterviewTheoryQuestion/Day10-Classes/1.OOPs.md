🔹 What is OOPS?

OOPS is a way of writing code where we model real-world things as objects.

👉 Example (real life):

Car

Student

Mobile

Bank Account

Each thing has:

Properties (data)

Methods (actions)

🔹 JavaScript is Prototype-based OOP

JavaScript does not work like Java/C++ internally.
It uses prototypes, but class syntax makes it easy to understand.

🧱 4 Main Pillars of OOPS

1️⃣ Object & Class
2️⃣ Encapsulation
3️⃣ Inheritance
4️⃣ Polymorphism

We’ll understand one by one.

1️⃣ Object

An object is a collection of properties + methods.

🧠 Example
let student = {
name: "Siya",
age: 14,
grade: 8,
study() {
console.log("Siya is studying");
}
};

student.study();

✔ name, age, grade → properties
✔ study() → method

2️⃣ Class (Blueprint)

A class is a template/blueprint to create objects.

👉 Like a form that many students fill.

🧠 Example
class Student {
constructor(name, age, grade) {
this.name = name;
this.age = age;
this.grade = grade;
}

study() {
console.log(`${this.name} is studying`);
}
}

let s1 = new Student("Siya", 14, 8);
let s2 = new Student("Riya", 15, 9);

s1.study();
s2.study();

✔ constructor() → runs automatically
✔ this → refers to current object

3️⃣ Encapsulation (Data Protection)

Encapsulation means:

Keep data safe + control access

In JavaScript we use:

#privateField (modern JS)

🧠 Example
class BankAccount {
#balance = 0; // private

deposit(amount) {
this.#balance += amount;
console.log("Amount deposited");
}

getBalance() {
return this.#balance;
}
}

let acc = new BankAccount();
acc.deposit(1000);
console.log(acc.getBalance());

❌ acc.#balance → ERROR
✔ Data is protected

4️⃣ Inheritance (Reuse Code)

Inheritance means:

One class uses another class’s properties & methods

🧠 Example
class Person {
constructor(name) {
this.name = name;
}

speak() {
console.log(`${this.name} is speaking`);
}
}

class Teacher extends Person {
teach() {
console.log(`${this.name} is teaching`);
}
}

let t1 = new Teacher("Sangeeta");
t1.speak();
t1.teach();

✔ extends → inheritance
✔ Avoids code duplication

5️⃣ Polymorphism (Many Forms)

Same method name → different behavior.

🧠 Example
class Animal {
sound() {
console.log("Animal makes sound");
}
}

class Dog extends Animal {
sound() {
console.log("Dog barks");
}
}

class Cat extends Animal {
sound() {
console.log("Cat meows");
}
}

let a1 = new Dog();
let a2 = new Cat();

a1.sound();
a2.sound();

✔ Same method sound()
✔ Different output

🔹 this Keyword (VERY Important)

this means → current object

class User {
constructor(name) {
this.name = name;
}

greet() {
console.log(`Hello ${this.name}`);
}
}

🔹 OOPS Without Class (Old JS – Prototype)

JavaScript originally works like this:

function Student(name) {
this.name = name;
}

Student.prototype.study = function () {
console.log(this.name + " is studying");
};

let s1 = new Student("Siya");
s1.study();

Classes are just syntax sugar over this.
