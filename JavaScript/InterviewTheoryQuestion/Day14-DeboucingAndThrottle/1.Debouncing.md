🧠 What is Debouncing? (Very Simple Words)

Debouncing means:
“Call a function only after the user has stopped doing something for a while.”

👉 If user keeps doing the action again and again,
👉 Previous calls are cancelled.

🏠 Real-Life Example (Best Way to Remember)
🔍 Google Search Box

You type: j, ja, jav, java

Google does NOT search on every key press

It waits till you stop typing

➡️ That waiting behavior = Debouncing
