3. What is hoisting in JavaScript?

🚀 What is Hoisting in JavaScript?
Hoisting means JavaScript moves declarations to the top of the current scope (like a function or block) before the code runs.

✅ Only declarations are hoisted, not initializations.

🧠 Think of hoisting like this:
JavaScript says: "Before I run the code, let me pull up all the var, let, const, and function declarations to the top, so I know they exist."

💡 Example 1: Hoisting with var
console.log(myName); // undefined (not error!)
var myName = "Sangeeta";
👉 Behind the scenes, JavaScript does this:

var myName; // Hoisted to the top
console.log(myName); // undefined
myName = "Sangeeta"; // Assigned later
❗ Example 2: let and const are not hoisted the same way

console.log(age); // ❌ ReferenceError: Cannot access 'age' before initialization
let age = 10;
This is because of something called the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ), which means:

"The variable is known, but can’t be used until it's actually declared."

💥 Example 3: Functions are fully hoisted

greet(); // ✅ Works fine

function greet() {
console.log("Hello!");
}
JavaScript pulls the whole function to the top, so it works even before the line it's written on.

Keyword	  Hoisted?	Initialized as?	 Can use before declaration?
var	     ✅ Yes	    undefined	     ⚠️ Yes (but gets undefined)
let	      ✅ Yes	    ❌ No (TDZ)	    ❌ No
const	   ✅ Yes	❌ No (TDZ)	     ❌ No
function   ✅ Yes	✅ Fully usable	✅ Yes
