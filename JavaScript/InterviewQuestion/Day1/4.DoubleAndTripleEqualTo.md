4. What is the difference between == and ===?

🔍 == vs === in JavaScript

Operator Name Checks for Converts Types?
== Loose Equality Value only ✅ Yes (Type coercion)
=== Strict Equality Value + Type ❌ No
🟡 == (Loose Equality)
👉 It checks only the value, but ignores the type. If the types are different, JavaScript tries to convert them to be the same type before comparing.

5 == "5"; // true (number == string, but string gets converted to number)
null == undefined; // true (they are loosely equal)
🔴 === (Strict Equality)
👉 It checks both value and type. If the types are not the same, it returns false immediately.

5 === "5"; // false (number !== string)
true === 1; // false (boolean !== number)
"hello" === "hello"; // true (same type and same value)
🧠 Simple Example to Remember

let a = 10;
let b = "10";

console.log(a == b); // true (because it converts "10" to 10)
console.log(a === b); // false (because one is number, one is string)

✅ Rule of Thumb (Best Practice)
Always use === (strict equality) to avoid unexpected bugs. It’s safer and clearer.

```js
"0" == 0; // ?
false == 0; // ?
null == false; // ?
undefined == null; // ?
true === 1; // ?
```
