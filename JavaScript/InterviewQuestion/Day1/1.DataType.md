1. What are the different data types in JavaScript?

üü¢ Primitive Data Types (Stored by value)
These are the basic data types:

String
Textual data
Example:

let name = "Sangeeta";
Number
Both integers and floating-point numbers
Example:

let age = 10;
let score = 99.5;
Boolean
Represents true or false
Example:

let isStudent = true;
Undefined
A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value
Example:

let city;
console.log(city); // undefined
Null
Represents an intentionally empty value
Example:

let emptyBox = null;
BigInt
Used for very large integers
Example:

let bigNumber = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
Symbol
Unique and immutable value (used mostly for object keys)
Example:

let sym = Symbol("id");
üü† Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types (Stored by reference)
These can hold collections of values:

Object
A collection of key-value pairs

let person = {
name: "Sangeeta",
age: 10
};
Array
A list-like object

let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
Function
A block of reusable code

function greet() {
console.log("Hello!");
}

```text
üéØ Summary Table:

Category	Type	Example
Primitive	String	"Hello"
Primitive	Number	42, 3.14
Primitive	Boolean	true, false
Primitive	Undefined	let x;
Primitive	Null	let x = null;
Primitive	BigInt	12345678901234567890n
Primitive	Symbol	Symbol("id")
Non-Primitive	Object	{ name: "Sam" }
Non-Primitive	Array	[1, 2, 3]
Non-Primitive	Function	function() {}

```

üîç Memory Visualization
üü¢ Primitive Data Types
Stored directly in the variable's memory location.

js
Copy
Edit
let a = 5;
let b = a;
b = 10;

console.log(a); // 5 (not affected by change in b)
üß† Explanation:

a has the value 5

b is a copy of a

Changing b does not affect a

üü† Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types
Stored as a reference (address in memory).

js
Copy
Edit
let obj1 = { name: "Sangeeta" };
let obj2 = obj1;
obj2.name = "Sona";

console.log(obj1.name); // "Sona" (because obj1 and obj2 point to same memory)
üß† Explanation:

obj1 holds a reference to the object

obj2 = obj1 means both point to the same object

Changing obj2 also changes obj1

‚úÖ Mini Quiz (Answer after trying yourself)
Q1: What will be the output?

let x = 10;
let y = x;
y = 20;
console.log(x); // ?

Q2: What will be the output?

let arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
let arr2 = arr1;
arr2.push(4);
console.log(arr1); // ?

Q3: What is the type of:
typeof null; // ?

Q4: What type of data is this:

let id = Symbol("uniqueId");
