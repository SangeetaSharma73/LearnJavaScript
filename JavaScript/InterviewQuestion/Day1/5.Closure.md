5. 🧠 What is a Closure?
   A closure is when a function remembers and can use variables from the place where it was created, even after that place is gone!

Think of it like this:

You have a backpack 🎒 (a function), and inside it you keep some toys 🧸 (variables).
Even if you go far from your house (the place where the backpack was packed), you can still play with the toys in your backpack.

📦 Example 1: A Simple Closure

```js
function outer() {
  let name = "Sangeeta";

  function inner() {
    console.log("Hello " + name);
  }

  return inner;
}

let greet = outer(); // greet is now the inner function
greet(); // Output: Hello Sangeeta
```

🧠 What Happened?
inner() is created inside outer().

It remembers the variable name = "Sangeeta" even after outer() is done running.

That's closure!

📦 Example 2: Closure with a Counter

````js
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;

  return function () {
    count++;
    console.log("Count is: " + count);
  };
}

let counter = createCounter();

counter(); // Count is: 1
counter(); // Count is: 2
counter(); // Count is: 3
```

💡 Why is this cool?
Even though createCounter() has finished running, the count variable is still remembered every time you call counter()!

🎮 Think of Closure Like a Game Level:
outer() is like Level 1.

inner() is like Player who can take things from Level 1 even after it's over!

🧪 Real Life Use of Closures:
Creating private variables (nobody else can change them).

Creating functions that remember data.

Timers, event handlers, and more.

🧠 Summary:

Term	Meaning
Closure	A function + the variables it remembers
Use	To keep data private or build smart logic
If you'd like, I can give you a fun game-based challenge to practice closures too! 🎲 Want it?

🏰 Game: Treasure Box Guard

🔑 Goal: You will create a secret treasure box where:
Only the person with the correct key (function) can open it.
You can add coins to the box.
You can check how many coins are inside.
No one can change the coin count directly — only through your special function!

👩‍💻 Code Template:

```js
function createTreasureBox() {
  let coins = 0; // this is private

  return {
    addCoin: function () {
      coins++;
      console.log("💰 One coin added!");
    },
    checkCoins: function () {
      console.log("🪙 Total coins: " + coins);
    },
  };
}

// Let's play the game:
let myBox = createTreasureBox();

myBox.addCoin(); // 💰 One coin added!
myBox.addCoin(); // 💰 One coin added!
myBox.checkCoins(); // 🪙 Total coins: 2

// Try to cheat:
console.log(myBox.coins); // undefined ❌
```

🧠 Why is this closure?
The coins variable is inside createTreasureBox().

It’s remembered by the functions addCoin and checkCoins.

But it's protected — no one outside can touch it!
