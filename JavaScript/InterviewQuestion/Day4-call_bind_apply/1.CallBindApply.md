# call bind apply

- 🔍 What Do They Do?
  All three methods are used to set the this value inside functions.​

call(): Invokes the function immediately, allowing you to pass arguments one by one.

apply(): Invokes the function immediately, but arguments are passed as an array.

bind(): Returns a new function with a bound this value and optional preset arguments, without invoking it immediately
