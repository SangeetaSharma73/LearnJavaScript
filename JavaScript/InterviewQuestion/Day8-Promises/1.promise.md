# What are Promises in JavaScript?

A **Promise** in JavaScript is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. Promises provide a cleaner alternative to callbacks for handling asynchronous code.

## States of a Promise

- **Pending**: Initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
- **Fulfilled**: The operation completed successfully.
- **Rejected**: The operation failed.

## Example

```javascript
// Creating a Promise
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    const success = true;
    if (success) {
      resolve("Operation was successful!");
    } else {
      reject("Operation failed.");
    }
  }, 1000);
});

// Consuming a Promise
myPromise
  .then(result => {
    console.log(result); // Output: Operation was successful!
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });

  Why Use Promises?
Avoids "callback hell"
Makes asynchronous code easier to read and maintain
Supports chaining with .then() and error handling with .catch()
```
