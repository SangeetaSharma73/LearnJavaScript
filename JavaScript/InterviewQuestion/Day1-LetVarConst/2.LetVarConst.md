2. What is the difference between var, let, and const?

- 🟢 var – The Old Way (ES5)
  ✅ Can re-declare and re-assign
  📦 Function-scoped
  ⚠️ Hoisted to the top of its scope (but undefined until it's used)

var fruit = "apple";
var fruit = "banana"; // Re-declaration allowed
fruit = "mango"; // Re-assignment allowed
console.log(fruit); // mango

- 🟡 let – The Modern Way (ES6)
  ✅ Can re-assign
  ❌ Cannot re-declare in the same block
  📦 Block-scoped (only works inside the {} it’s declared in)

let animal = "cat";
// let animal = "dog"; ❌ Error: already declared in the same scope
animal = "dog"; // ✅ Allowed
console.log(animal); // dog

- 🔴 const – The Lock-it Way (ES6)
  ❌ Cannot re-declare
  ❌ Cannot re-assign
  📦 Block-scoped

const color = "red";
// color = "blue"; ❌ Error: can't re-assign
console.log(color); // red
BUT if const is used with objects or arrays, the reference can’t change, but the contents can be modified:

const person = { name: "Sangeeta" };
person.name = "Sona"; // ✅ Allowed
console.log(person); // { name: "Sona" }
