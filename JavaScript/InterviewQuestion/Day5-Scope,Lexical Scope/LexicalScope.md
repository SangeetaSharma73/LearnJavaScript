# üîç What is Lexical Scope?

Lexical Scope means that a function‚Äôs scope is determined by its location in the source code. In other words, functions can access variables from the scope in which they were defined, not where they are called.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Point

JavaScript uses **lexical scoping**, not dynamic scoping.

This means the structure of your code (the nesting of blocks and functions) determines what variables are accessible.

---

## üß† Example: Lexical Scope in Action

```javascript
function outer() {
  let outerVar = "I'm from outer";

  function inner() {
    console.log(outerVar); // ‚úÖ inner can access outerVar
  }

  inner();
}

outer();
```

**What‚Äôs happening?**

- The function `inner()` is defined inside `outer()`.
- It lexically inherits access to all variables in `outer()`'s scope.
- So `outerVar` is accessible inside `inner()`.
- Even if `inner()` was called elsewhere, it would still retain access to `outerVar` because of where it was defined, not where it's called.

## ‚ùå Counter-Example: Dynamic Scope (Not JavaScript)

If JS had dynamic scoping (which it doesn‚Äôt), it would behave like this (just conceptual):

```javascript
let name = "global";

function sayName() {
  console.log(name);
}

function run() {
  let name = "local";
  sayName(); // Still logs "global" in JS, because sayName was defined in global scope
}

run();
```

**Output:**

```
global
```

Because `sayName()` was defined in the global scope, it doesn't care that `run()` has a `name` variable. That's Lexical Scope.

---

## ‚úÖ Lexical Scope Visualized (Scope Chain)

When a function executes, JavaScript looks for variables in this order:

1. Current Function Scope
2. Parent Scope
3. Global Scope

```javascript
let a = 10;

function outer() {
  let b = 20;

  function inner() {
    let c = 30;
    console.log(a, b, c); // ‚úÖ Has access to all variables in its lexical scope
  }

  inner();
}

outer();
```

**Output:**

```
10 20 30
```

---

## üöÄ Lexical Scope + Closures

Lexical scope enables closures in JavaScript.

```javascript
function outer() {
  let count = 0;

  return function inner() {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  };
}

const counter = outer(); // `inner` is returned
counter(); // 1
counter(); // 2
```

Here, `inner()` has lexical access to `count`, even after `outer()` has finished executing. That's closure powered by lexical scope.
