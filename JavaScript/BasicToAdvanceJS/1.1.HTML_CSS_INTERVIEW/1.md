# HTML BASICS

## Semantic tag :
🏷️ Semantic Tags (in HTML)
✅ Meaning:
Semantic tags clearly describe the meaning of the content inside them — both to the browser and the developer.

📚 "Semantic" means “with meaning.”

💡 Examples of Semantic Tags:
Tag	What it means
<header>	Top of the page or section
<nav>	Navigation menu
<main>	Main content of the page
<section>	A specific section like “About Us”
<article>	Independent content like blog post
<aside>	Sidebar or related info
<footer>	Bottom of the page
🎯 Why use them?
Makes your code easier to read and understand 🧠

Helps SEO (Google ranks you better) 📈

Makes websites more accessible (for screen readers) ♿

🌐 Meta Tags (in <head> of HTML)
✅ Meaning:
Meta tags give information about the webpage (not visible to users, but useful for browsers and search engines).

They go inside the <head> tag.

💡 Examples of Meta Tags:


<!-- Defines the character set -->
<meta charset="UTF-8" />

<!-- Responsive design for all devices -->
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

<!-- Description for search engines -->
<meta name="description" content="Student Activity Tracker for daily study progress" />

<!-- Keywords for SEO -->
<meta name="keywords" content="student, tracker, tasks, study, motivation" />

<!-- Author info -->
<meta name="author" content="Your Name" />
🧠 Quick Memory Tip:
🟡 Semantic Tags = "What you see on the page"
🟣 Meta Tags = "What the browser knows about the page"
