// Dynamic Typing

// JS is a dynamically typed language. a dynamically typed language is a programming language in which the type of a variable is determined at runtime, not at compile time. 

// In dynamic type languages, you can change the type of a variable during the program's execution. This is in contrast to statically typed languages where variable types are explicitly declared and checked at compile time.

var x = 5; // x is now of type number
x = "Hello, World!"; // x is now of type string
x = [1, 2, 3]; // x is now an array






// ## Coding Challenge 1

// Write a JavaScript function that takes a variable `x` as an argument and returns its type. Do not use any built-in functions or methods to determine the type.

// ## Coding Challenge 2

// Write a JavaScript function that takes an array as an argument and returns a new array with the same elements, but with each element's type converted to a string. For example, if the input array is `[1, "hello", true]`, the output should be `["number", "string", "boolean"]`.

// ## Coding Challenge 3

// Write a JavaScript function that takes a variable `x` as an argument and checks if its type is "object". The function should return `true` if the type is "object", and `false` otherwise.
