## 🟢 1️⃣ Test the /product/:productId route

👉 Your code:
app.post("/product/:productId", logging, (req, res) => {
res.status(200).json({ productId: req.params.productId });
});

✅ To test this in Thunder Client or Postman:
Set method to POST
Set URL to: http://localhost:5000/product/123
Click Send

👉 You should see this JSON in response:

{
"productId": "123"
}

and in the console you will see:
URL and method : /product/123, POST

🟢 2️⃣ Test the /search query route

👉 Your code:
app.get("/search", logging, (req, res) => {
res.json({ term: req.query.term, category: req.query.category });
});

✅ To test in Thunder Client or Postman:

Set method to GET
Set URL to:http://localhost:5000/search?term=mobile&category=electronics
Click Send

👉 You will see in the response:

{
"term": "mobile",
"category": "electronics"
}
and in your terminal logs:
URL and method : /search?term=mobile&category=electronics, GET
mobile electronics

## 🚀 Summary

✅ Just remember:

route parameters (like :productId) → change the path segment in the URL

query parameters (?term=x&category=y) → add key/value pairs after the ? in the URL

Thunder Client steps recap:

select method (GET or POST)

put in the full URL

hit “Send”

see results in response
