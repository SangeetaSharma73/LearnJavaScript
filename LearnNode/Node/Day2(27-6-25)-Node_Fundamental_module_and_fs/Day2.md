# üìÖ Day 2: Node.js Fundamentals ‚Äì Modules & File System

## üéØ Goal:

- Learn how Node.js uses modules
- Work with built-in core modules like fs (file system)
- Understand how to organize code into files
- Practice reading and writing files

Node.js Core Modules (Common Examples)
Node ships with a set of built-in modules. You don‚Äôt need to install them with npm; you can use them right away with require().

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ fs (File System)

### üëâ Purpose:

Work with the file system ‚Äî reading, writing, deleting files.

### ‚úÖ Example pattern:

- Read a file
- Write to a file
- Append to a file

// fs.readFile(path, , callback) 2. Binary Buffer Array (Buffer)
What it is:
A Buffer is a raw memory allocation of bytes, not yet interpreted as characters. It‚Äôs essentially an array of binary data.

In Node.js:
If you don‚Äôt provide an encoding when reading a file, Node returns a Buffer.

Use Cases:
Useful for working with binary files (images, PDFs, etc.) or doing low-level byte manipulation.

<!-- fs.readFileSync(path) -->

- readFile takes a file path and a callback
- gives you the data in the callback

// fs.writeFile(path, content, callback)

- writes content to a file
- overwrites if file exists

// fs.appendFile(path, content, callback)

- adds content to the end of a file

### Common use case:

- Reading a config file
- Saving user data
- Logging to a file

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ path

### üëâ Purpose:

Work with file or folder paths in a safe, cross-platform way.

### ‚úÖ Example pattern:

- Join segments of a path

```js
const path = require("path");

const fullPath = path.join("folder", "subfolder", "file.txt");
console.log(fullPath);
// Output (cross-platform): folder/subfolder/file.txt
```

- Resolve relative vs absolute paths

### Absolute Paths:

- An absolute path specifies the complete location of a file or directory, starting from the root directory of the file system (e.g., / on Unix-like systems or `C:\` on Windows).
- It provides a unique and unambiguous way to locate resources regardless of the current working directory.
- For example, on a Unix-like system, /home/user/documents/report.txt is an absolute path.

```txt
On Windows, C:\Users\User\Documents\report.txt is an absolute path.
```

### Relative Paths:

- A relative path specifies the location of a file or directory in relation to the current working directory.
- It doesn't include the full path from the root, making it dependent on the current context.
- Relative paths use special notations:
- . (dot) refers to the current directory.
- .. (double dot) refers to the parent directory.
- For example, if the current directory is /home/user, then documents/report.txt is a relative path that refers to /home/user/documents/report.txt.

```js
const absolutePath = path.resolve("folder", "file.txt");
console.log(absolutePath);
// Output: /Users/you/project/folder/file.txt (depends on where you run it)
```

- Get file extensions

```js
const fileExtension = path.extname("image.png");
console.log(fileExtension);
// Output: .png
```

```js
path.join(a, b, c);
path.resolve(a, b);
path.extname(file);
```

## Common use case:

- Building a path to save a file
- Determining if a file has .txt extension

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ os

### üëâ Purpose:

Get operating system‚Äìlevel info.

### ‚úÖ Example pattern:

- Get platform name
- Check total memory
- See the current user info

```js
os.platform();
os.totalmem();
os.cpus();
```

### Common use case:

- Show stats on a dashboard
- Log environment for debugging

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ http

### üëâ Purpose:

Create an HTTP server without frameworks like Express.

### ‚úÖ Example pattern:

- Create a server
- Listen on a port
- Handle a request/response

```js
const http = require("http");

// Create the server
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  // Log the request method and URL
  console.log(`Request received: ${req.method} ${req.url}`);

  // Set response headers
  res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/plain" });

  // Send response
  res.end("Hello from the server!");
});

// Choose a port
const PORT = 3000;

// Start the server
server.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is listening on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

```js
http.createServer((req, res) => { ... })
res.writeHead()
res.end()
```

### Common use case:

- Build raw servers
- Learn the basics of HTTP
- Understand how frameworks work under the hood

### üöÄ How to use them

In any Node project you can do:

```js
const fs = require("fs");
const path = require("path");
const os = require("os");
const http = require("http");
```

These modules are always available, no npm install needed.

. ASCII Value
What it is:
ASCII is a character encoding standard using 7 bits to represent characters (values 0‚Äì127). It covers basic English letters, digits, and punctuation.

In Node.js:
When you read a file as 'ascii', Node interprets bytes as characters directly based on the ASCII table.

Limitations:
Only works correctly for English and very basic symbols. Not suitable for international characters or emojis.

Example:

js
Copy
Edit
const data = fs.readFileSync('file.txt', 'ascii');
console.log(data); // Outputs readable ASCII text 2. Binary Buffer Array (Buffer)
What it is:
A Buffer is a raw memory allocation of bytes, not yet interpreted as characters. It‚Äôs essentially an array of binary data.

In Node.js:
If you don‚Äôt provide an encoding when reading a file, Node returns a Buffer.

Use Cases:
Useful for working with binary files (images, PDFs, etc.) or doing low-level byte manipulation.

Example:

js
Copy
Edit
const buffer = fs.readFileSync('file.txt');
console.log(buffer); // <Buffer 48 65 6c 6c 6f ...>
console.log(buffer[0]); // 72 (decimal ASCII code for first byte) 3. UTF-8
What it is:
UTF-8 is a variable-length character encoding for Unicode. It supports all characters in every human language.

In Node.js:
If you read a file as 'utf8', Node interprets the bytes as a UTF-8 encoded string.

Advantages:
Supports special characters, emojis, non-English scripts, etc.

Example:

js
Copy
Edit
const text = fs.readFileSync('file.txt', 'utf8');
console.log(text); // Properly shows characters like √©, ‰∏≠, or üòä
