üöÄ What is Asynchronous JavaScript?
Asynchronous JavaScript allows you to perform long-running tasks (like API calls, reading files, database queries) without blocking the main thread. This helps make applications faster and more responsive.

Instead of waiting for a task to finish, the program can continue executing other code and come back to the result later.

üîÑ Real-Life Analogy
Imagine ordering food at a restaurant.

You place your order (start a task).

The chef prepares the food (background task).

While you wait, you check your phone or talk to friends (other code keeps running).

When food is ready, the waiter brings it to you (callback or response).

This is how asynchronous code works.

üß† Why Async is Important in Node.js
Node.js uses a single-threaded event loop, so blocking operations (like reading a big file or calling a slow API) can freeze your entire server. That‚Äôs why Node encourages async operations using:

Callbacks

Promises

async/await

‚úÖ Common Asynchronous Patterns

1. Callback (old way)

```js
const fs = require("fs");

fs.readFile("file.txt", "utf-8", (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error("Error reading file:", err);
    return;
  }
  console.log("File data:", data);
});

console.log("This will run before file is read!");
```

The file is read in the background, and when it's done, the callback is executed.

2. Promises (modern)

const fetch = require("node-fetch");

fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1")
.then((res) => res.json())
.then((data) => console.log("Post title:", data.title))
.catch((err) => console.error("Error:", err)); 3. async/await (cleanest modern syntax)

```js
const fetch = require("node-fetch");

const getPost = async () => {
  try {
    const res = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1");
    const data = await res.json();
    console.log("Post:", data.title);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Failed to fetch post:", err);
  }
};

getPost();
```

await pauses execution until the promise resolves. Cleaner and easier to read.

‚ö†Ô∏è Synchronous vs Asynchronous
Type Example Blocks?
Sync const data = fs.readFileSync(...) ‚úÖ Yes
Async fs.readFile(..., callback) ‚ùå No

üîç Quick Summary
Asynchronous JS lets your code run without blocking.

Node.js uses async techniques to scale efficiently.

You‚Äôll often use:

fs.readFile, axios, fetch, DB queries ‚Äî all are async.

Use async/await for modern, clean syntax.
